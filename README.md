# Mapping_Earthquakes

This project is a layered map showing earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plates.  Those are the 3 overlays and there are 3 different tiles available for the map.  Sattellite streets, streets, and the dark view.

This layered map uses different functions to create the different looks and legends.
